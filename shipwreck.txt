// This is a shipwreck tale! :D

{I}-You and your friends were saling across the
Atlantic Ocean in a very sturdy vessel. So
sturdy in fact that there was no way it could
crash... right? Could it crash? Theres no
need to worry about that. Probably. Just
relax and enjoy the trip :D

{S}-Your day starts out just like any other. You
wake up and leave your cabin, heading down
to the mess hall to look for some food.

\nWhat should you grab to eat?
[Orange]-A very large orange.
[Fish]-Fish.
[Bread]-Some questionable bread.
[Banana]-A banana :o

{Orange}-Why did you choose this? Do you like, have
a problem? You chose a very large orange.
Are you ok? Oh well. You're probably fine.

\nHow are you going to eat the very large orange?
[Spoon]-A very large spoon.
[Knife]-A very large knife.
[Hands]-Just use your hands.

{Fish}-You're eating fish? For breakfast? You
know what, you're right. You're on vacation.
Eat whatever you want. What could go wrong.

\nYou eat the fish. Are you happy now? Hmph.
Continuing on with your morning, you make your
way onto the deck. The sea is a bit chaotic,
but you know that your trusty vessel will manage.

\nWhat shall you do next?
[Stay]-Stay up on deck.
[Bed]-Go back to bed.
[Hungry]-Go eat more.

{Banana}- You eat a banana. How unique. You must have
decided that that was enough food. You make your
way up onto the deck.

\nWhat shall you do next?
[Stay]-Stay up on deck.
[Bed]-Go back to bed.

{Spoon}-You use a spoon to eat an orange? I mean...
If it works, it works. I guess whatever
floats your boat. You eat the orange, and
feel full afterwards. You make your way
up onto the deck.

\nWhat shall you do next?
[Stay]-Stay up on deck.
[Bed]-Go back to bed.

{Hands}-You wanted to use your hands? Are you dumb?
You do realize that this is an orange.
Eh, you know what. I'm going to give
you another chance.

\nWould you like to choose a different tool?
[Orange]-Yes.
[BadOrange]-No.

{Hungry}-You're still hungry.

\nWhat would you like to eat?
[Orange]-A very large orange.
[Bread]-Some questionable bread.
[Banana]-A banana :o

// Endings.
<Bread>-What did you expect to happen??
There's mold on the bread you idiot. You
take one bite and immediately feel sick.
As the light surrounding you fades all you
can think about is how badly you must have
wanted that bread...

<Knife>-You chose to eat the orange with a very
large knife. How did you think this would
end? Oh well. As you're trying to cut the
orange the knife slips...

<Bed>-You go back to bed. What an odd morning.
Maybe things will be different when
you wake back up...

<BadOrange>-You try and try to use your hands to
eat the orange. But it just isn't working.
It's getting annoying. You should just
give up. And you do. What a strange way
to end a story...

<Stay>-You greet the shark as you walk past it.
Wait, wait. You greet the WHAT. You
freeze. Theres a shark. Right behind
you. Welp. It looks like the real
snack was you all along...
